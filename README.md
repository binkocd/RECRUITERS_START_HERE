## Usage

```sh
Please use my LinkedIn Profile for any and all initial job reach outs. If you did not get an email address from me, then I am probably not going to respond to you. If you have made it this far, then do the right thing and use official channels for non-harrassment communications. Thank you and have a great day!
```

## Run tests

```sh
Did you go to LinkedIn?
```
